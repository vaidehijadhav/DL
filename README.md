# Sppu Practicals (Deep Learning)
Fourth Year Practical
# 1. Install Required Libearies
In this 1st practical we have to install different python libaries like tensorflow, keras, pytorch etc.
# 2. Implementing Feedforward neural networks with Keras and TensorFlow
a. Import the necessary packages b. Load the training and testing data (MNIST/CIFAR10) c. Define the network architecture using Keras d. Train the model using SGD e. Evaluate the network f. Plot the training loss and accuracy
# 3. Build the Image classification model by dividing the model into following 4 stages:
a. Loading and preprocessing the image data b. Defining the model’s architecture c. Training the model d. Estimating the model’s performance
# 4.Use Autoencoder to implement anomaly detection. Build the model by using:
a. Import required libraries
b. Upload / access the dataset
c. Encoder converts it into latent representation
d. Decoder networks convert it back to the original input
e. Compile the models with Optimizer, Loss, and Evaluation Metrics
